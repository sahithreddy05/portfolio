            <h1>The Mentalist</h1>
            <p>
                The Mentalist is an American drama television series that ran from September 23, 2008, until February
                18, 2015, broadcasting 151 episodes over seven seasons, on CBS.[1] Created by Bruno Heller, who was also
                its executive producer, the show follows former "psychic" Patrick Jane (Simon Baker), who is a
                consultant to the California Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and his boss, a senior agent, Teresa Lisbon
                (Robin Tunney), using the highly developed observational skills he previously employed to "read"
                people's minds.

                The series follows Patrick Jane, an independent consultant for the California Bureau of Investigation
                (CBI) based in Sacramento, California. Although not an officer of the law, he uses his skills from his
                former career as a successful, yet admittedly fraudulent, psychic medium to help a team of CBI agents
                solve murders. The real reason for Jane's involvement with law enforcement is to track down the serial
                killer known as Red John, who was responsible for the brutal murders of his wife, Angela Ruskin Jane,
                and his daughter, Charlotte Anne Jane.
